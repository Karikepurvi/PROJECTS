I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the opportunity to work on these projects during my internship. The experience significantly enhanced my skills in data extraction, cleaning, analysis, and modeling.

This repository contains two real-world projects completed as part of my internship. Both projects focus on using Python for data-driven problem-solving â€” one with machine learning for price prediction, and the other with web scraping for market trend analysis. These projects helped me strengthen my understanding of data science, web scraping, and practical visualization techniques.

**Project 1: Airbnb Dynamic Pricing Recommendation Engine**

     Objective :- To build a model that predicts optimal Airbnb listing prices based on location, seasonality, and listing features.
 
     Tools Used:- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn
              Excel: For initial data handling
              
**Project 2: Job Trend Analysis using Web Scraping**

       Objective :-To scrape job postings from job portals and analyze trending technical skills by role and city.
  
       Tools Used :- Python: BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
                HTML: Saved job listing pages 
                Excel: For exporting final data

This internship project helped bridge the gap between academic learning and industry application. Thank you once again for this invaluable experience.
